1.  You need to make a circuits.mp file and type all the circuit generating code into it.
2.  MetaPost the circuits.mp file TWICE to get the labels to appear.  (I did this in Ubuntu Linux from the command prompt.)
3.  Next, you need a circuits.tex file in which you include the output from the circuits.mp file
4.  Then do a LaTeX => PS => PDF on your .tex file.
5.  Then do an includegraphics with the .pdf extension
